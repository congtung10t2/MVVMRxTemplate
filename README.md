# MVVM Rxswift Template
A simple template include view controller and view model. Quickly add new view controller with standard architecture into your MVVM Rxswift project


To install the template: 


- Include ViewModelType.swift into your project (If you didn't include it yet)


- Put file “ViewControllerRx.xctemplate” in ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File Templates/Custom Templates/


Ps: By default, you cannot find the template folder. Run the following command (or create it manually): 

mkdir ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/Custom Templates
